# Tri-M-Lab-Pd-Intro-Guide
# A guide I'm working on to introduce new lab members to Pure Data
Welcome to Pure Data.

#Pure data extended is the program you want.
#Pure data vanilla has less functionality, but can be installed on anything (linux, rasberry pi's, etc.)

#Feel free to e-mail me at sglandry@mtu.edu if you run into any trouble or have any general questions.

OK THE GOOD STUFF
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Look at the first patch, 1-Pd Basics.pd
Learn some basics structure of objects, and controlling the pitch and volume of a sine wave oscilator. 

Then go to the help menu dropdown, Pd Help Browser, Manuals, Start Here/, start-here.pd. Follow the instructions inside the patch. This will teach you how to use "cables" to connect object's outlets to other object's inlets. 

Now go back to my list of patches. Check out 2-Signals controlling signals.pd


Hopefully this won't scare you off Pd. If you don't care about sound physics, don't worry, we're almost done with the basics. Check out the patch 3-Additive synthesis and envelopes.pd

Maybe 4-Linear ramp generators.pd should be before 3-additive synthesis and envelopes. 

6-Metronome and counting.pd
